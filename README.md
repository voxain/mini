![Status - Unmaintained](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Unmaintained-critical?style=for-the-badge)

⚠️ Since this is a fun little weekend-project, it is not actively maintained and not intended for production use. There might be security vulnerabilities which I am not fixing. Host at your own risk.

## How to set up
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Run `npm i` in the repo folder.
3. Change the config to your needs (see section below).
4. Run `npm start` and enjoy!

## Config
Alter the values in the config.json. These are the options you can set:
* `baseURL`: The URL the redirection will be performed on. Must have a trailing `/`.
* `appPort`: The port the content will be served on. Default is `8151`
* `cooldown`: Per-IP Cooldown for generating links in seconds. Default is `60`, that means an IP is allowed one request within 60 seconds.
* `expiration`: For how long a link will be kept. Default is `24` Hours.
